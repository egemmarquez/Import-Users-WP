# Import-Users-WP
Small plugin for Wordpress which imports users from a local database to a WP database as WPUsers
Version 0.94 
- Plugin Works. Creates users using email as username and password.

What's pending:
- Create a way to split the amount of users registered at the same time, to prevent overflow and server crashes.
- Users Real Name should be pulled from the database too.
- Create a custom class to remove users created in case you want to rollback.
